/// Asynchronously removes a directory and all its contents.

/// This function takes a string reference as an argument, which represents the directory to be removed.
/// It first reads the directory and counts the number of entries. Then, it creates a progress bar with the total number of entries.
/// It iterates over each entry in the directory. If the entry is a directory, it removes the directory and all its contents. If the entry is a file, it removes the file.
/// After removing each entry, it updates the progress bar.
/// Finally, it attempts to remove the directory itself. If this operation fails, it returns an error.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `directory` - A string reference representing the directory to be removed.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// This function returns a `Result` that indicates whether the operation was successful.
/// If the operation was successful, the function returns `Ok(())`.
/// If the operation failed, the function returns `Err` with a description of the error.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// let directory = "/path/to/directory";
/// remove_dir(directory).await;
