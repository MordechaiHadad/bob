      description: |
        Please attempt to diagnose whether the build failure is with Bob itself or with downloading/building a Neovim version.
        Try using `bob use <version>` with a nightly version (which builds from the git repo) and a stable non-nightly version (e.g., 0.11.0).
        Describe what happened in each case.
      placeholder: |
        ex: When using nightly: 
        ... 

        ex: When using stable 0.11.0:
